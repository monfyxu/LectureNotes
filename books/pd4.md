# §4 - Implications of Developmental Levels of Organization

- to set **realistic goals** in avoidance of client demoralization and therapist burnout
- to help clients with the most compelling maturational tasks on their levels (flowering of creativity or attainment of minimal awareness)

## 4.1 Therapy with Neurotic-Level Patients

Psychoanalysis works best with healthier patients.

### Psychoanalysis and Open-Ended Psychoanalytic Therapies

- **insight-oriented therapy**
- establish working alliance quickly
- behavior change **in spite of psychology** → behavior change **congruent with insides** (e.g., early sobriety resisting temptation vs. late sobriety without urge)
- classic psychoanalysis → psychoanalytic/psychodynamic: point our themes & patterns, encourage openness, focus on feelings, push past defensiveness

### Short-Term Treatments and Nonpsychodynamic Therapies

Any approach to therapy will be helpful...

## 4.2 Therapy with Psychotic-Level Patients

**supportive therapy:** support dignity, self-esteem, ego strength, and need for info & guidance

- supportive: support ego in its struggle to contain & repress conflicts
- expressive: full expression of intrapsychic conflict

### Explicit Safety, Respect, Honesty

- **trustworthiness:** not to reinforce the primitive images of hostile and omnipotent authority
- **counteract frightening expectations**
- **behave with unwavering honesty:** more emotional self-disclosure
- **take irritation:** explore perceptions only after counteracting potential apprehension
- **give specific rationales:** e.g., the reason why we charge is to earn a living and to be helpful without feeling resentful.
- **self disclose:** risky but productive
- **help in a more specific, problem-solving way:** e.g., to give advice and rationales

Be more authoritative enough to withstand fantasied destructiveness, which will help to develop sense of security.

### Education

**Normalization** is vital to emotional equilibrium, mitigates terror, welcome clients to "join the human race".

**Interpreting up:** name the contents in the depths and explain why that material would have been set off by their life experiences.

### Identification of Triggers
- wait until the client pauses
- do not imply craziness
- help the client figure out what set off the intense feeling
- **accept distortions:** does not express agreement with interpretations, neither inflict the wound. Instead, invite further discussion, or, after enough self-expression, ask about alternative explanations of perceptions

## 4.3 Therapy with Borderline Patients

They need **highly structured therapy**.
Aim: develop an integrated, dependable, complex, and positively valued send of self.

### Safeguarding boundaries and Tolerating Emotional Intensity

Unstable ego states: symbiotic attachment vs. hostile, isolated separateness
**Consistent conditions must be set. End the session gently but firmly.**

Therapeutic messages:
- see the client have confidence to **tolerate frustration**
- refuse to be exploited and is therefore a model of self-respect



### Voicing Contrasting Feeling States

With neurotic clients, less is more. They would feel expanded in their awareness as a result.

**BUT**, borderline clients lack the reflective capacity. One must emphasize **the interpretation as additional information about self**. (e.g., "there is also a part of you ...", "it seems to coexist with ...")

### Interpreting Primitive Defenses

rarely helpful to make genetic (historical) interpretations
**interpret here-and-now emotional situation**

**Projective Identification:** clients keep feeling whatever is projected, along with the need to make it fit (e.g., therapist gets the client's anger and begins to feel a rage and misunderstanding when the client insists he is crazy *because the therapist is hostile*.)

> **Response:** You seem to have a conviction that you are bad. You're angry about that, and you're handling that anger by saying that I am the one who is bad, and that it's my anger that causes yours. **_Could you imagine that both you and I could be some combination of good and bad and that that wouldn't have to be such a big deal_**? 

**Intention: to integrate different parts into an overall identity**

### Getting Supervision from the Patient

Borderline clients tend to put therapist in two mutually exclusive options where both would be wrong...

**solution:** explain the quandary and ask the client to help solve the problem.

**effects:** reduce uneasiness, model an acceptance of uncertainty, affirms the client's dignity and creativity

### Promoting Individuation and discouraging Regression

- confront regressive and self-destructive behaviors actively (non-responsive to subjective helplessness)
- endorse empathically efforts toward autonomy and competence (appreciation of assertiveness)

### Interpreting during Quiescence

**Comment on client's rage/panic/desperate regression only after the state is over.** (reversed for neurotic clients) Because in a state of intense feeling, the client may receive a comment as **condemnation** or even **contemptible** (which may increase fury or shame)

### Respecting Countertransference Data

- Intuitive, affective and imaginal responses of therapist (boredom, rage, panicky, overwhelm, sexual images) are sometimes **"put"** (projected) into by clients. **It's therapeutic to reflect the observed and felt (by therapist) feelings to clients.**
- Countertransference, if only handled with self-examination, would be of little help to client.
- Be **emotionally "real"** with borderline clients (disclose feelings and explore further).
- Share responsibility for what goes on in the dyad.

## 4.4 Interaction of Maturational and Typological Dimension of Character


- **Developmental Dimension:** Neurotic-to-healthy, Borderline, Psychotic
- **Typological Dimension (habitual use of defense):** Psychopathic, Narcissistic, Schizoid, Paranoid, Depressive, Masochistic, Obsessive compulsive, Hysterical, Other
