# §8 Narcissistic Personalities

**There's something missing from their inner lives – inner sense of, and/or terror of, insufficiency, shame, weakness, and inferiority.**

understand pathology not as fixation on normal infantile grandiosity but as **compensatory for early disappointments in relationship**.

## Drive, Affect, and Temperament in Narcissism

- **Narcissistic extension:** child's natural intuitive talents are unconsciously exploited and grows up confused about whose life he/she is supposed to lead
- **Drive:** Innately strong aggressive drive or constitutionally determined lack of tolerace for anxiety about aggressive impulses
- **Affect** 
    - **Shame:** being seen as bad or wrong
    - **Envy:** If I feel deficient and I perceive you as ahving it all, I may try to destroy what you have by deploring, scorning, or ridiculing it.
    
## Defensive and Adaptive Processes in Narcissism

### Idealization & Devaluation
- Comparative prestige

### Perfectionism
hold up to unrealistic ideas and either
- convince themselves that they have attained them (grandiose outcome)
- respond to their falling short by feeling inherently flawed rather than forfivably human (depressive outcome)

**its self-defeating solution:** nothing short of perfection will make up for them, and yet, since no one is perfect, the strategy is doomed, and the depreciated self emerges again.

## Relational Patterns in Narcissism

Therapy goal: to accept a person nonjudgmentally and non-exploitively; to express genuine feelings without shame. Therapist's acceptance of them can become the prototype for their emotional understanding of intimacy.

Their need for others is deep, but their love for them is shallow.

### Constant Evaluation
Narcissistic psychology springs from a **particular attention** or even doting, in which support is given on the implicti conditon that the **child cooperate with a parent's narcissistic agenda**. The key lies whether the child also gets attention unrelated to parent's aims.

## The Narcissitic Self

- Grandiose (all-good) vs. Depleted (all-bad)
- Sensitive to gragility
- Deny remorse and gratitude (remorse includes an admission of defect; gratitude adknowledges one's need)
- Need external affirmation in order to feel internal validity

## Transference and Countertransference with Narcissistic Patients

### Transference
- Lack of interest in exploring the therapeutic relationship
- Devalue or idealize intensely

### Countertransference
- Being obliterated / made invisible
- Boredom, irritability, sleepiness, and a vague sense that nothing is happening in the treatment

### Mechanism

The client projects either the grandiose or the devalued part of the self, and the therapist becomes **a container for the internal process of self-esteem maintenance**. The disposition to feel flawed as a therapist is a virtually inevitable **mirror** of the patient's core worries about self-worth.


## Therapeutic Implications of the Diagnosis of Narcissism

### Competing Theories

- **Kohut:** a plant whose growth was stunted by too little water and sun at critical points – _benign acceptance of idealization or devaluation and unwavering empahy for the patient's experience_
- **Kernberg:** a plant that has mutated into a hybrid – _tactful but insistent confrontation of grandiosity and systematic interpretation of defenses against envy and greed_

### Implications

- Patience (embody a nonjudgmental, relistic attitutde)
- Acknowledgment of errors (confirms the client's perception of mistreatment and **sets and example** of maintaining self-esteem while admitting to shortcomings)
- Mindful of the person's latent self-state
- Expand the narcissistic patent's awareness of, and honesty about, the nature of his/her behavior **without stimulating so much shame** ("Did you make your needs explicit?")
- Hard to probe transference, yet narcissistic person actually needs the therapist more than do people without significant self-esteem deficits
