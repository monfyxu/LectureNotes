# §2 - Psychoanalytic Character Diagnosis

Basis of understanding Personality

**Fixation:** freud original drive theory–at what early maturational phase is this person psychologically stuck?

**Defense:** ego psychology–what are this person’s typical ways of avoiding anxiety?

## 2.1 Classic freudian Drive Theory and Its Developmental Tilt

Central complaint is reducible to a problem managing an instinctual urge and its inhibitors

### Freud’s drive model—biologism

| Age | Psychosexual phase | Pathology | Cause |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0-1.5 | Oral | Depressive personality | Neglected or overindulged |
| 1.5-3 | Anal | Obsessional personality |  |
| 3-6 | Phallic/oedipal | Hysterical | Rejection or/and overstimulating seductiveness |

### Erickson’s ego psychology

| Phase | Freudian | Interpersonal and intrapsychic tasks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0-1.5 | Oral | Establishment basic trust vs. lack of trust |
| 1.5-3 | Anal | Attainment of autonomy vs. shame and doubt |
| 3-6 | Oedipal | Develop a sense of basic efficacy, initiative vs. guilt; a sense of pleasure in identification with one’s love objects |

### Margret Mahler’s separation-individuation process

| Age | Phase |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0-6 weeks | **Autistic** Relative unawareness of others |
| 6weeks-2yrs | **Symbiotic** relatedness Hatching; practicing; rapproachment; on the way to object constancy |

### Melanie Klein & Thomas Ogden

| Phase | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1  Autistic-contiguous position | A sensory-dominated, presymbolic area of experience in which the most primitive form of meaning is generated on the basis of the organization of sensory impressions, particularly at the skin surface |
| 2 Paranoid-schizoid position | Infant not fully appreciated the separateness of other people |
| 3 Depressive position | Infant has come to understand the caregiver is outside the child’s omnipotent control and has a separate mind ; Appreciation of the separate subjective lives of others |

## 2.2 Ego Psychology

Central complaint is reducible to the inflexible operation of particular defenses against anxiety

Therapeutic split in the ego

* **observing ego:** conscious and rational part of patient’s self can comment on emotional experience, allies with therapist to understand the total self
* **experience ego:** sense of what is going on in the therapy relationship
* **ego alien:** client announce part of her is evil
* **ego syntonic:** inappropriately punitive superego, client announce she is evil
* **ego strength:** a person’s capacity to acknowledge reality, even when it is extremely unpleasant, without resorting to more primitive defenses such as denial.

* more mature defense: accommodation to reality

* more archaic defense: psychological avoidance, radical distortion of disturbing facts of life

**Psychological health:** have mature defenses and use a variety of defenses

**Freud’s view of defenses**

* Original: anxious reactions are caused by defenses, mostly by repression
* Structural theory: repression is response to anxiety, repression is only one of the way human beings try to avoid an unbearable degree of irrational fear.
* Psychopathology: a state in which a defensive effort has not worked, where the anxiety is felt in spite of one’s habitual means of warding off, or where the behavior that masks the anxiety is self-destructive.

## 2.3 Object Relation Theory

Central complaint is reducible to the activation of internal objects from which the patient had inadequately differentiated
