# §3 - Developmental Levels of Personality Organization

## 3.1 Diagnosing Level of Character Pathology


Two-dimension continuum

- degree of pathology (psychotic, borderline, neurotic)
- type of character (paranoid, depressive, schizoid, etc.)

### Neurosis vs. Psychosis

#### Neurotic

- appreciation of reality
- ego defenses too automatic and inflexible, cutting them off from id energies that could be put to creative use
- aim at weakening the defenses and getting access to the id to form more constructive activity

#### Psychotic

- loss of contact with reality
- ego defense too weak, leaving them helplessly overwhelmed by primitive material from the id
- aim at strengthening defenses, covering over primitive preoccupations, encouraging reality testing

### Symptom Neurosis, Neurotic Character, Psychosis

#### Symptom Neurosis

= DSM disorder

- activated an unconscious conflict & maladaptive mechanisms to cope
- therapist task: to determine the conflict, help understand and process the emotions connected to it, and develop **new resolutions**
- strong transference cooperation

#### Neurotic Character

= DSM personality disorder.

It's more challenging to foster personality change!

- **educative role:** to make immediate relief from suffering (what clients want) and modification of personality (what therapists see as necessary) compatible
- immediate "working alliance" (clients may easily feel alone or under attack)
- expect therapy to be less exciting, less surprising and less dramatic (be prepared to deal with boredom, impatience, irritability and demoralization)

#### Drawbacks of Taxonomy

- Not all character problems are always more pathological than neuroses
- There is no way to indicate level of severity of character disturbances

### Borderline Conditions

Borderline as a **level of functioning**, not merely borderline personality disorder (BPD)
Borderline: a stable instability of the border between the neurotic and psychotic ranges, characterized by lack of identity integration and reliance on primitive defenses without overall loss of reality testing.

| - | psychotic- | borderline- | neurotic- |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Erickson's stage | primary dependency issues (trust vs. mistrust) | secondary separation–individuation issues (autonomy vs. shame & doubt) | advanced level of identification (initiative vs. guilt) |
| Etiology | could not differentiate between what was inside and outside themselves | fixated in dyadic struggles between total enmeshment (identity obliteration) and isolation (traumatic abandonment) | conflicts between things they wished and things they feared |
| Anxiety | fear of annihilation (brain's FEAR system) | separation anxiety (Panksepp's PANIC system) | unconscious conflict, especially fear of enacting guilty wishes |

## 3.2 Overview of the Neurotic–Borderline–Psychotic Spectrum


Discuss levels of character structure in terms of favored defenses, level of identity integration, adequacy of reality testing, capacity to observe one's pathology, nature of one's primary conflict, and transference and countertransference.

### Neurotic-Level Personality Structure

- mature or second-order defenses (sometimes primitive defenses) **The absence of mature defenses (vs. the presence of primitive defenses) rules out the diagnosis of neurotic level of character structure**
- integrated and consistent sense of identity, behavior and inner experience
- in solid touch with "reality" (ego alien)
- capacity for "therapeutic spit" between **observing** and **experiencing** parts of self
- conflicts between what they want and obstacles to attaining it (so to remove inhibitions against love and work)
- benign, sound working alliance; not overwhelming countertransference

### Psychotic-Level Personality Structure

- hallucinations, delusions, ideas of reference, illogical thinking
- preverbal & pre-rational defenses
- grave difficulties with identity (vague, tangential, concrete, or distorting description of self and others)
- no anchored in reality (ego syntonic)
- lack "reflective functioning", internal differentiation between id, ego and superego, and between observing and expreiencing aspects of ego
- **existential conflict:** life vs. death, existence vs. obliteration, safety vs. terror (they expend so much energy fighting off existential terror that none was left to use in the service of coping with reality)
- positive countertransference (subjective omnipotence, parental protectiveness, and deep soul-level empathy)

**Be careful about the consuming feature!**

### Borderline Personality Organization

- primitive defenses: denial, projective identification, and splitting
- temporary responsiveness to confrontation (_cf._ psychotic: further agitation)
- self is full of **inconsistency and discontinuity** (dismiss therapists' interest in complexities)
- lack degree of existential terror (_cf._ psychotic: strong existential)
- hostile when confronted (_cf._ psychotic: too worried about losing sense of being to resent)
- deny psychopathology (limitation of insight) yet still show a level of discrimination about what is real (_cf._ psychotic: totally confused)
- lack reflective functioning, like talking to an observing ego
- strong and unambivalent transference and resistant to ordinary interventions
- **strong and upsetting countertransference** (oversolicitous or punitive)
