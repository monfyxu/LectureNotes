# §10 Paranoid Personality 

**Core: Dealing with one's felt negative qualities by disavowing and projecting them; the disowned attributes then feel like external threats (experiencing what is inside as if it were ouside the self)**

## Drive, Affect, and Temperament in Paranoia

###aggression or irritability

High levels of aggression is hard for a young child to manage and integrate into a positively valued sens of self, and negative responses of caregivers would reinforce the child's sens that outsiders are persecutory.

###fear

"annihilation anxiety", the terror of falling apart, being destroyed, disappearing from the earth

###shame

- **use denial and projection so that no sense of shame remains accessible** (*cf.* narcissistic: efforts to impress others so that de devalued self will not be exposed)
- **afraid of other people's malevolence** (*cf.* narcissistic: afraid of revealing inadequacies)


### envy 

handled projectively: yearning for closeness with the same sex → deny it → project onto the partner → fantasies of infidelity

### guilt

- terror of that when therapist really gets to know them, they will be shocked and punish them
- transform sense of culpability in the self into dangers from the outside

## Defensive and Adaptive Processes in Paranoia

### Psychotic

- upsetting parts of the self are fully believed to be "out there"
- cannot find ways to make his beliefs fit with conventional notions of reality

### Borderline

- people on whom disowned attitudes are projected are subtly provoked to feel those attitude
- make projection "fit" the target (trying to get rid of certain feelings)

### Neurotic

- ego-alien (observing part of the self is capable of acknowledging the externalized contents)

## Relational Patterns in Paranoid Psychology

- **criticism, capricious punishment, adults who cannot be pleased, and utter mortification** (scapegoat) – sense of efficacy insulted, overpowered and humiliated
- **unmanageable anxiety in a primary caregiver** – parents either deny or catastrophize about problem – cannot console the child
  - both reality and normal emotional reactions are disconfirmed, instilling fear and shame rather than being understood
  - denial and projection are modeled
  - primitive **omnipotent fantasies** are reinforced, laying the foundation for a diffuse and overwhelming guilt
  - interaction creates additional anger while resolving none of the original distress, magnifying confusion about basic feelings and perceptions
- **Example:** frightening parents and the absence of people who can help process the feelings
- still capable of deep attachment and protracted loyalty

## The Paranoid Self

**impotent, humiliated, and despised image of the self versus an omnipotent, vindicated, triumphant one**

- **Weak side:** fear
- **Grandiose side:** ideas of reference (everything has something to do with them personally)
- **Megalomania:** cause unbearable guilt (all terrible things are my fault) – unbearable attitude is denied and projected
- **Core:** profound emotional isolation and need for "consensual validation" (recognition) – enhance self-esteem through power against authorities

## Transference and Countertransference with Paranoid Patients

- **Transference:** projected savior images but seen as disconfirming and humiliating (grim, humorless, and poised to criticize)

- **Countertransference** 
  - anxious or hostile
  - benevolently grandiose when regarded as a savior
  - emotional reaction to what the client has exiled from consciousness (e.g., fear towards client hostility)
  - "set the patient straight"
  - powerlessness to give much immediate help

## Therapeutic Implications of the Diagnosis of Paranoid Personality

  - avoid direct confrontation
  - offer other interpretive possibilities with suitable tentativeness
  - avoid asking them to explicitly accept or reject the therapist's ideas
- **Make repeated distinctions between thoughts and actions**
  - enjoy the most heinous fantasies as examples of remarkable, creative perversity human nature
- **Be hyperattentive to boundaries**
  - maintain consistency 
  - risk of pseudo-erotic transference storms (especially for same-sex therapist)
- **Convey both personal strength and unequivocal frankness**
