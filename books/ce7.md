# Corrective (Emotional) Experience in Person-centered Therapy: Carl Rogers and Gloria Redux

> only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. live in fragments no longer.

—E. m. Forster, Howard’s End


Definition of CE

> CEs are ones in which a person comes to understand or experience affectively an event or relationship in a dif- ferent and unexpected way

This definition omits aspects we regard as important, such as the expectation that significant change experiences occur in the context of a meaningful relationship.


## CE in Classical Person-centered Theory: Three Strands

### CE and Conditions of Worth

The mechanism of correction in the conditions-of-worth account is the therapist’s unconditional positive regard

empathy: regard the process of understanding his basic feelings as a worthwhile undertaking

genuineness: live in a closer relation- ship to his own experiencing

**cf. with CBT and psychodynamic**

The **client**, rather than the therapist or the theory, **evaluates the correctness of the emergent alternative**. altered by creating a different, more accepting sense of self, not by suggesting a rational alternative valuing system or an accurate interpretation

### CE and the Process Theory

The process theory describes therapeu- tic change as a developmental sequence.

> [in response to the therapeutic conditions, the client] begins to show cer- tain characteristic changes. . . . he shows a change in the manner of his experiencing of his feelings, moving from a remoteness from what is going on in his organism to an ability to experience feelings and personal mean- ings with immediacy. he changes in the way he construes experience, from rigid constructs which are thought of as  xed facts to a recognition that he is the creator of these constructs and that they are best held tentatively and are subject to checking. he changes in his manner of relating to his problems, from viewing them as entirely outside himself to accepting his own contributions to his problems and the degree of his responsibility for them. he changes in his manner of relating to others, from avoiding any close or expressive relationships to living openly and freely in such rela- tionships. (pp. 12–13)


1. It does not restrict the source of  xity and rigidity to early primary relationships.
2. Change is not restricted to reconciling the self-concept with experience but may involve many or all of a person’s concepts.
(Clients move from feeling distant from their experience and holding constructs rigidly toward feeling open to experience and holding constructs flexibly; healing the split between self-concept and experience → changing the person’s way of being)

### CE as Unblocking

Empathic listening within the therapeutic relationship opens the premises to reexamination and thus unblocks or frees up the person’s creative potential, including his or her self-healing process.
