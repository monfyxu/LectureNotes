# Corrective (Emotional) Experience in Person-centered Therapy: Carl Rogers and Gloria Redux

> only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. live in fragments no longer.

—E. m. Forster, Howard’s End


Definition of CE

> CEs are ones in which a person comes to understand or experience affectively an event or relationship in a dif- ferent and unexpected way

This definition omits aspects we regard as important, such as the expectation that significant change experiences occur **in the context of a meaningful relationship**.


## CE in Classical Person-Centered Theory: Three Strands

### CE and Conditions of Worth

The mechanism of correction in the conditions-of-worth account is the therapist’s unconditional positive regard

**Empathy:** regard the process of understanding his basic feelings as a worthwhile undertaking

**Genuineness:** live in a closer relation- ship to his own experiencing

#### **cf. with CBT and psychodynamic**

The **client**, rather than the therapist or the theory, **evaluates the correctness of the emergent alternative**. altered by creating a different, more accepting sense of self, not by suggesting a rational alternative valuing system or an accurate interpretation

### CE and the Process Theory

The process theory describes therapeu- tic change as a developmental sequence.

> [in response to the therapeutic conditions, the client] begins to show cer- tain characteristic changes. . . . he shows a change in the manner of his experiencing of his feelings, moving from a remoteness from what is going on in his organism to an ability to experience feelings and personal mean- ings with immediacy. he changes in the way he construes experience, from rigid constructs which are thought of as  xed facts to a recognition that he is the creator of these constructs and that they are best held tentatively and are subject to checking. he changes in his manner of relating to his problems, from viewing them as entirely outside himself to accepting his own contributions to his problems and the degree of his responsibility for them. he changes in his manner of relating to others, from avoiding any close or expressive relationships to living openly and freely in such rela- tionships. (pp. 12–13)


1. It does not restrict the source of  xity and rigidity to early primary relationships.
2. Change is not restricted to reconciling the self-concept with experience but may involve many or all of a person’s concepts. (Clients move from feeling distant from their experience and holding constructs rigidly toward feeling open to experience and holding constructs flexibly; healing the split between self-concept and experience → changing the person’s way of being)

### CE as Unblocking

Empathic listening within the therapeutic relationship opens the premises to reexamination and thus unblocks or frees up the person’s creative potential, including his or her self-healing process.

## Contemporary Elaborations

### The Client as Active Self-Healer

The events clients see as helpful may be ones that their therapists had not intended to be especially helpful or even noticed.

### CE as Building Meaning Bridges

The goal of therapy can be seen as turning problematic experiences into personal resources. **Internal discrepancies can be voiced, examined, and resolved through com- promise or creative synthesis**

The therapeutic task here can be understood as providing a context in which the opposing parts of the self can each be heard and can work toward ways of understanding each other and engaging in joint action (build meaning bridges with each other).

> you sound as though your actions were kind of outside of you. you want to approve of you, but what you do somehow won’t let you approve of yourself.

The practical problem was not immediately solved, but a psychological barrier to  nding a solution had been overcome.

## Corrective Emotional Experience in Person-Centered Therapy and Contemporary Relational Dynamic Psychotherapy: Sort of the Same, But not Really

Classical Freudian: insight is corrective

Alexander’s (1946) concept of CE was that experience in therapy could alter behavior directly, without conceptual mediation, although it might subsequently lead to insight or understanding.

- From a psychodynamic perspecitve: I still believe that the expression of feelings, as powerful as this is, **should be accompanied by subsequent attempts to understand what happened and to process the meaning of new experiences**.
- From a person-centered perspective, understanding feelings or maladaptive patterns is at best incidental to the growth process.
