# §4 Self-Awareness

> Every human has four endowments––self-awareness, conscience, independent will, and creative imagination. These ultimate human freedom ... the power to choose, to respond, to change.> ––*Stephen Covey*

Self-awareness

- a stable characteristic (self-knowledge or self-insight; Who am I?)
- a stat of heightened self-focus (sensitivity in the here-and-now; What am I feeling this moment?)

## Self-Knowledge and Self-Insight

### Characteristics of helpers
- listen carefully and empathically
- nonjudgmental
- open to new experiences and perspectives
- approachable & friendly
- have hope, love, kindness, flexibility, curiosity, creativity, persistence, humility and humor
- ...
- some may be negative
 - perfectionism
 - each of tolerance for ambiguity
 - defensiveness
 - lack of willingness to explore difficult topics (e.g., anger, sexual attraction)

### Motivations for Wanting to Help

***Other-oriented motivations***

- make a difference in people's lives
- experienced therapy themselves as clients when in struggle
- work for social change

***Self-oriented motivations***

- view helping as consistent with cultural values
- allowed to work with clients who are striving toward actualisation of their potential
- intellectually challenging to help others (personal growth)
- altruism
- fulfill personal needs (e.g., savior, authority, & intimacy)
- prestige & glory

### Awareness of biases so called *hot buttons*, can be based on:

- cultural factors 
- personal backgrounds

difficult to work with clients who

- committed crimes (rape, abuse, murder, etc.)
- express hostility (anger, disrespect, etc.)
- might trigger countertransference
- are different on any salient dimension (race, nationality, age)
- are too similar to therapist

### Strategies to increase self-knowledge/self-insight

- psychotherapy
- recognize personal issues 
- learn about the process of helping
- self-reflection  
- mindfulness 
- journaling 

## State of heightened self-focus

- use inner experiences as a tool for understanding process
- personal issues may unconsciously influence the helping process
- double track: attention to clients & own reaction 
- sometimes need to back off immediate reactions but keep track of them later and try to understand where they come from

### Types of in-the-moment self-awareness

- facilitative (mindful, accepting)
- hindering (anxious)

### Strategies to increase facilitative self-awareness and decreasing interfering self-awareness

- increase self-awareness
- increase self-compassion
- explore/gain insight or make action plans
- in sessions with clients 
- make a mental note and come back after the session 
- do a body scan
- supervision
- review sessions
- healthy lifestyle

## What do you think?

What impact or role do you think the less-positive motivations for becoming a helper have on the helping process? **Is it possible that they could even be helpful?**
