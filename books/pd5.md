# §5 - Primary Defensive Processes

**Goal of defense:**

* avoidance of management of some powerful, threatening feeling \(anxiety, grief, shame, envy, etc.\)
* maintenance of self-esteem

**Primary Defense:** the boundary of _the self and the outer world_

* a lack of the reality principle
* a lack of appreciation of the separateness and constancy of those outside the self

**Secondary Defense:** internal boundary between the ego, superego and the id, or _between the observing and the experiencing_ parts of the ego

**It is the absence of mature defenses, not the presence of primitive ones, that characterizes borderline or psychotic structure.**

## Extreme Withdrawal

* **Definition:** retreat from social or interpersonal situations & substitute the stimulation of internal fantasy world
* **Possible causes:** emotional intrusion/impingement, neglect and isolation
* **Consequences:** 
  * generate a rich internal fantasy life and regard the external world as problematic or affectively impoverished
  * **schizoid personality**
* **Disadvantages:** remove the person from active participation in interpersonal problem solving
* **Advantage:** psychological escape from reality requires little distortion, unusually sensitive

## Denial

* **Definition:** refuse to accept the unpleasant experiences are happening \(e.g., if I don't acknowledge it, it isn't happening\)
* compounded in more mature defenses \(e.g., rationalization, reaction formation\)
* **Consequences:** **mania** \(denying personal limitations and weaknesses\)   

**When depression makes the painful facts of life supremely unignorable, mania make them seem insignificant.**

## Omnipotent Control

* **Definition:** the external world is felt as isomorphic with the internal one; one controls the world
* **Advantages:** feelings of competence and effectiveness
* **Consequences:** **psychopathic \(antisocial\) personality**; "getting over on" \(cheat on/manipulate/make use of\) others

## Extreme Idealization and Devaluation

* **Definition**  
  * **Idealization:** fantasies of the omnipotence of caregiver; psychological merger with caregiver \(in front of hostility to seek security\) 
  * **Devaluation:** downside of the need to idealize
* **Consequences** 
  * **narcissistic personality** \(contaminated by the idea that one must perfect the self rather than accept it\)
  * extreme hate and rage if promise is failed to be delivered

## Projection, Introjection, and Projective Identification

#### Projection

the process whereby what is inside is misunderstood as coming from outside

* basis for empathy \(project our experience in order to understand\)
* interpersonal damage \(distort others or project negative parts of the self\)

#### Introjection

~ what is outside is misunderstood as coming frome inside

* primitive identification \(internalization\)
* destructive introjection \(identification with the aggressor to master fright and pain\)
* **depression** / emptiness \(loss of an internalized one; children believe there's sth wrong with them, i.e., moral defense\)

#### Projective Identification

> In projective identification, not only does the patient view the therapist in a distorted way that is determined by the patient's past object relations; in addition, pressure is exerted on the therapist to experience himself in a way that is congruent with the patient's unconscious fantasy \(Ogden, 1982, pp.2–3\)

The client both **projects internal objects** and gets the person on whom they are projected to **behave like those objects**, as if the target person had those same introjects.

**Example**

A: I know I have no resason to believe you're critical of me, but I can't help thinking that you are.

B: You shrinks all love to sit back and judge people, and I don't give a shit what you think!

* self-reflection \(ego alien / syntonic\)
* the extent to which projective process gets rid of troublesome feelings
* emotional effects \(countertransference\)

**self-fulfilling prophecy:** may feel less crazy if one can induce in someone else the feelings.

## Splitting of the Ego

**Definition:** splitting between **the good and the bad experiences** \(lack of ambivalence implying opposite feelings toward a constant object\)

* involves distortion
* may create splits in others, too 

## Somatization

* **Definition:** to express emotional states physically
* lack of words for affect expression \(culturally related\)

## Acting Out \(Defensive Enactment\)

* **Definition:** putting into action what one lacks the words to express 
* **Reason:** the unconscious / disassociated nature transforms passive → active, helplessness & vulnerability → agency & power
* **Examples:** exhibitionism, voyeurism, sadism, masochism, etc.
* **Consequences:** **impulsive personality**

## Sexualizatiion \(Instinctualization\)

* A subtype of acting out
* **Definition:** convert terror or pain or other overwhelming sensation into sexual excitement \(life-affirming feeling\)
* **Gender difference:** Women are more apt to sexualize dependency and men to sexualize aggression.
* **Examples:** 
  * masturbate to reduce anxiety
  * those in relatively weak position convert envy, hostility and fear into sexual scenario **to compensate for lack of power with recourse to erotic power**.

## Extreme Dissociation

* **Definition:** out-of-body experiences
* **Consequences:** **disassociative identity disorder** \(multiple personalities\)
* **Advantages:** cut off pain, terror, horror, and conviction of imminent death
* **Drawbacks:** operate automatically under non-life-threatening conditions
