# §6 - Secondary Defensive Processes

No summary of defenses can be complete. The selection of defenses was covered according to:
- frequency mentioned by literature and therapists
- relevance to particular character patterns

## Repression

- **Definition:** motivated forgetting or ignoring (apply to a total experience, affect or fantasies/wishes)
- **Cause:** deal with developmentally normal but unrealizable and frightening strivings, thus relegating them to unconsciousness. (*cf.* trauma, episodic memory is shut down)
- **Consequence**
  - when fails to keep disturbing ideas out of consciousness and cannot accommodate to reality
  - gets in the way of certain positive aspects of living
  - excludes other more successful ways of coping
  - **hysterical personality**

**An element of repression is present in most of higher-order defenses.**

## Regression

- **Definition:** One (after trying out a new way of behaving) reverts to old habits of thought,feeling, and behavior **unconsciously**.
- Example
  - A man lashes out at his wife just after attaining some new level of intimacy with her


## Isolation of Affect

- **Definition:** the affective aspect is sequestered from its cognitive dimension (more discriminative than dissociation)
- **Consequence:** obsessive

## Interllectualization
talk about feeling in a way that  strikes the listener as emotionless (like weather reporter)

## Rationalization & Moralization

**Rationalization**

- seeks cognitively acceptable grounds for direction
- converts what the person already wants into reasonable language

**Moralization**

- seeks ways to feel it is one's *duty* to pursue that course
- puts what the person wants into the realm of the justified or morally obligatory
- as an advanced version of splitting
- moral masochism

## Compartmentalization

- **Definition:** to permit two conflicting conditions two exist without conscious confusion, guilt, shame, or anxiety (a rift between incompatible cognitions) and will rationalized the contradictions away.
- **Example:** 
  - espouse the importance of open communication while defend the position of not speaking to somebody
  - humanitarians in the public yet defend the abuse of children

## Undoing

- **Definition:** to counterbalance some affect (guilt or shame) with an attitude or behavior that will magically erase it
- **Consequence:** compulsive behaviors

## Turning against the Self

- **Definition:** to redirect of some negative affect or attitude from an external object toward the self (self-attack)
- **Example:** Children criticized themselves to distract them from the much more upsetting fact that their well-being depends on an undependable adult (more in control of upsetting situations)
- **Consequence:** **depressive personalities**

## Displacement

- **Definition:** redirection of a drive, emotion, preoccupation, or behavior from its initial or natural object to another because of anxiety
- **Example:** displacement of anxiety from a fraught area to a specific object symbolizing the dreadful phenomenon (bridge = life transition ultimately to grave)
- **Consequence:** phobic 

## Reaction Formation

- **Definition:** to turn something into its polar opposite in order to render it less threatening
- **Characteristic:** deny ambivalence
- **Example:** paranoid people only feel hatred and suspicion when also feeling long and dependency

## Reversal

- **Definition:** to switch one's position from subject to object or vice versa (yearning to be cared for → taking care of another person)
- **Example:** "I am sensitive, and I know you're tired/depressed"
- **Consequence:**

## Identification

- **Definition:** deliberately, and partly unconsciously, to become like another person
- **Example:** main vehicle through which people recover from emotional suffering (therapeutic bonding as curing)

## Sublimation

- **Definition:** a creative, healthful, socially acceptable or benefically resolution of internal conflicts between primitive urges and inhibiting forces
- **Characteristics:** the healthiest
  - it fosters behavior beneficial to the species
  - it discharges impulse instead of wasting a lot of emotional energy either transforming it into something else (reaction formation), or counteracting it with an opposing force (denial, repression)

## Humor

- **Definition:** a driven need to be constantly funny and to avoid feeling life's inevitable pain
- **Consequence:** hypomanic personality
