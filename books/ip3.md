# ยง3 - Honoring the client's resistance

## Conceptual Overview

Resistance can mean:

* **shame** (most frequently driven by)
* guilt
* disloyal
* anxiety
* ambivalent feelings

**HONOR = to acknowledge its historic adaptive value**

## Reluctance to address resistance

### Two-step sequence to work with resistance

1. enter supportively to the client's frame of reference, affirm/validate the reality-based constraints they perceive
2. inquire about other conflicted feelings or psychological meanings that entering treatment may hold **in a tentative manner**

### The therapists' reluctance to work with resistance

1. not so aware of the multiple meanings and conflicted feelings associated with the decision to enter treatment  
2. have strong needs for their clients to like them / feelings of failure
3. do not inquire about signs of potential resistance in order to ward off unwanted criticism
