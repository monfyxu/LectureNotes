# §11 Depressive and Manic Personalities

# Depressive Personalities

- **Ordinary greif:** external world is experienced as diminished
- **Depression:** what feels lost or damaged is a part of the self

**Two Subtypes**
- **Introjective** version (self-definition): I'm not good enough, I'm flawed, I'm self-indulgent, I'm evil ...
- **Anaclitic** version (self-in-relationship): I'm empty, I'm hungry, I'm lonely, I need a connection ...

## Drive, Affect, and Temperament in Depression

- **Precursor:** premature loss, either overindulgence or deprived
- **Affect**
    - Aggression inward (aim negative affect away from others and toward the self)
    - Guilt (especially for introjective type), partly conscious, ego-syntonic, pervasive sense of culpability
    - Sadness
- **Temperament**
    - Easy to like and admire
    - Generous, sensitive, and compassionate to a fault (aim hatred and criticism inward)
    - Appreciate therapy (give others the benefit of any doubt, strive to preserve relationships at any cost)


## Defensive and Adaptive Processes in Depression

### Introjection

like internalized object speaking

Positive attributes of the object are remembered fondly, but negative ones are felt as **part of the self**.

Images of a malevolent or injured abandoner are too painful to bear, and because of the hope for a loving reunion, they are driven out of awareness and felt as a bad part of the self. 

If one believes **it is one's badness** that drove the beloved objects away, one may try very hard to feel nothing but positive affects toward them (accounts for why people stay in unhealthy relationships). 

### Turning against the self

- gains a reduction in anxiety
- maintains a sense of power

### How to deal with unreliable caregivers

- **Accept (anaclitic)** – life is empty – powerless & passive
- **Deny (introjective)** – I am bad & self-improvement – yet powerful in badness

### Idealization

- Hold others in excessively high regard & feel diminished
- Seek idealized objects to compensate for diminution
- Feel inferior to those objects

## Relational Patterns in Depressive Psychology

- Early and/or repeated loss if parent
    - Induces guilt ("I'll be so lonely without you") → normal wishes to be aggresive and independent are hurtful
    - Pushed away defensively ("Why can't you play by yourself?!") → learn to hate natural dependent needs
    - **Either way, an important part of the self is experienced as bad**
- Difficult conditions for child to understand
    - generate assumptions about badness taht are impossible to counteract
- Neglect of children's needs when beset by difficulties
- Discouraging mourning/self-care
- Emotional or actual abandonment with parental criticism
- Significant derpession in a parent
