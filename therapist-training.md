### Therapeutic factors (Grawe)
- Clarification (insight)
- Problem activation (action)
- Mastery of problems (ability/skill promotion)
- Resource activation (potential)

Deeper change process involves stronger emotions
Integrative stance 

Problem:
- Not aware if off track (vs. train engine)
- Not a challenge of life an death (vs. secret agent)


### Properties of experts
- Superior in their own domain
- Better perception of meaningful patterns
- Fast in the solution of problems
- Speed with few errors
- Superior short as well as long term memory
- Problems on a deeper (more fundamental) level
- much time invested to analyze problems qualitatively
- Self-monitoring-abilities
- Anticipate feasibility of solution,

Less differences between experienced and inexperienced psychotherapists than other professionals
- Higher overall skills
- Soft criteria, lack of feedback (hard to relate certain skills to outcomes)
	

### Learning from practice
- Feedback delayed, hard to relate to interventions
- Empirical: attempt of protecting us from the most obvious errors

### Development of professional  expertise 
(Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 2005)
- Realize simple rules are suboptimal
- Admit insecurity

Rational-analytic --->  **atheorectical**

Automatization saves time of processing information, independent of conscious or intuitive 

### Intuition -- apprehension without reasoning
Depends on how often used and how useful (Hammond)

### Intuitive tasks in psychotherapy
- Framing of raw information (MBTI &
- "Soft" information (unlabeled & unclear & ambiguity)
- Nonverbal behavior
- Pattern recognition (Li's paper)
- Check for completeness / compatibility
- Simultaneous consideration of many aspects (multi-task)
- Rational-analytic: DSM-diagnosis

Experts work more intuitively
Expert intuition develops from endless runs of conscious processing
For novice: rational-analytical practicing = fastest way to good expert intuition

Research of flame/ caster

Deliberate Practice -- fastest way to expertise
Practice --- feedback --- repetition & correction
